5. claude-flow (july 2025) - https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow?tab=readme-ov-file#-advanced-hooks-system
- you have to explain this system in particular, that's where we are now, give example, comamnd, explain the MCP.

# Modes (orchestrator, coder, debugger, etc)
Understand this file: learn-to-flow/ressources/.roomodes
And I want you to explain clearly how these modes are added to roocode, how are they being used. 
Why to use them over others, etc.
