🔲 NEW BRAND SYSTEM (REVERSED)
Update all site colors, layouts, and visuals to reflect this dark-first UI identity:

🎨 Color Palette (Dark UI First)
Role	Name	HEX	Usage
Background	Deep Graphite	#1c1c1c	Full-page background
Primary Text	Paper White	#f7f5f3	Main readable content text
Accent Panels	Muted Beige	#d3af81	Section backgrounds, emphasis areas
Border/Support	Soft Ash Gray	#b4b4b4	Dividers, secondary UI labels
CTA Buttons	Metallic Bronze	#c19d62	Button backgrounds, hover indicators
Hover Accent	Pale Gold Tint	#e1caa3	Button hover, icon accents

🔤 Typography
Headers: Satoshi or General Sans — bold, geometric

Body: IBM Plex Sans or Inter — legible, no-nonsense

Code snippets/UI terms: JetBrains Mono

All text must be white or soft ash gray on dark backgrounds. Accent headers and inline CTA links can use Metallic Bronze.

📐 Layout & Components
Use beige cards or blocks on top of dark backgrounds

All buttons should be square, bold, and contrast-heavy

Avoid drop shadows. Use hard edges and clean spacing

Minimize motion — use it only for CTA hover, tab transitions, etc.

Cards and sections should follow a grid-based layout (max-width: 1200px)

✍️ Copywriting / Brand Voice
Voice: Clean, experienced, developer-native

Tone: Sharp. No fluff. Short sentences.

Always emphasize control, clarity, and systemization

Avoid long-winded promises. Deliver a "we know what we’re doing" feel

Taglines to incorporate:
“Code less. Ship smarter.”

“The end of vibe coding.”

“Structure. Speed. NEWCODE.”
