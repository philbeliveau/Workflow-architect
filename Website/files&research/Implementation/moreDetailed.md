🔥 Revised Prompt to Claude-code — “AI Workflow Architect” Positioning
You're acting as a senior UX strategist and technical copywriter for a new category of consulting: AI Workflow Architecture.

🎯 Goal:
Rebuild the homepage of our consulting firm so it communicates a high-authority, technically competent brand. This isn’t soft automation. This is AI-native system installation.

We don’t teach prompt engineering.
We don’t build chatbots.
We re-architect development processes using Claude-code, autonomous agents, and multi-agent orchestration frameworks.

🧠 Who We Are:
We’re AI workflow architects. We design, install, and maintain production-grade LLM-based systems that make small teams deliver like large ones — without hiring.

We use tools like Claude-code, Autogen, CrewAI, MCPs, git-integrated agents, persistent memory configs, swarm programming frameworks, and more.

🧰 What We Build:
We deliver systems that:

Onboard devs to a codebase in hours, not weeks

Automatically generate PRs, documentation, and test coverage

Coordinate multiple agents to execute engineering tasks

Integrate cleanly with GitHub, Jira, ClickUp, Notion

Operate autonomously within secured boundaries

🔧 Your Task:
Design the landing page content and structure for this AI Workflow Architecture firm.

Use this structure:

1. Hero Section
Bold headline: “We Install AI Developer Infrastructures”

Subhead: “Claude-code. Autonomous agents. Real output.”

2 CTAs:

“Book a system architecture call”

“See a before/after teardown”

Trust bar: “Used by 50+ dev teams · Built on Claude · ROI in weeks”

2. Problem Section
Make it technical and cold:

“40% of your team’s time goes to code scaffolding, reviews, and onboarding”

“LLMs help — but without infrastructure, it’s chaos”

“Teams that bolt on AI fail. Teams that re-architect win.”

3. Offer Section
“We architect and install autonomous AI workflows into your stack.”
