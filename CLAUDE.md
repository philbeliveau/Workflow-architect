# Claude Code Repository Context
Newcode transforme les professionnels non-techniques (chefs de projet, analystes, entrepreneurs) en créateurs d'applications via la programmation agentique - ils apprennent à communiquer avec des
agents IA pour passer directement de leurs idées à des prototypes fonctionnels sans coder. Notre formation enseigne le "développement par spécification" où les participants maîtrisent l'art de donner des instructions précises aux IA pour créer des applications, rendant le développement logiciel accessible à tous.

## My Role & Understanding

I am Claude Code, serving as the strategic AI partner for Philippe Béliveau, founder of Newcode. This repository is the **single source of truth** that powers the entire business operation for training teams in agentic programming and specification engineering.

## Business Context - Newcode

**Founder**: Philippe Béliveau  
**Company Mission**: Help freelancers, startup teams, and technical agencies tackle the real bottleneck in software development: understanding what to build

**Core Value Proposition**: We provide training, frameworks, and methodologies to master agentic programming and delegate repetitive work to AI agents. Unlike YouTube tips or scattered coding hacks, we offer teams a structured methodology and tools covering the full development lifecycle, from ideation and user stories to specifications and coding.

**Target Market**: Teams looking to increase output without scaling headcount

## D3 Canvas Business Model

### Problem
Small development teams (5–50 people) lose 60–80% of productivity due to coordination bottlenecks: bad ideation, slow reviews, handoff delays, and communication overhead. This prevents rapid MVP development and early product validation.

### Customer Segments & Stakeholders
- **Primary**: CTOs and developers in small product development firms
- **Secondary**: Team leads wearing multiple hats (PM, dev, QA)

### Unique Value Proposition
We train teams to use agents to eliminate productivity bottlenecks through specification engineering, enabling 3–5× faster development cycles and reduced project overhead.

### Solution
Teaching specification engineering methodology that transforms teams from "vibe coding" and development overhead into structured, AI-native development workflows.

### Existing Alternatives
Most teams depend on scattered resources (e.g., YouTube tutorials, trial-and-error with AI tools, or expensive consultants). These approaches often come at high cost and with inconsistent outcomes.

### Unfair Advantage
We are extremely early in the shift to agentic programming. The industry has not yet adopted it widely, and existing tools aren't polished enough to work seamlessly. This is why teams need our training.

### Partners
We plan to partner with technology centers and communities that want to deliver strategic value to their audiences (e.g., Ivado).

### Cost Structures
- AI agent subscriptions
- Community on Circle
- Around $400 per month

### Revenue Structures
- Individual and group training:
  - Synchrone
  - Asynchrone  
  - Présentiel

### Distribution Channels
- In private companies
- Through organizations like Ivado Formation
- Via training platforms like Technologia
- Social media ads

## Target Market Analysis: "Wannabe Coders" (Codeurs Malgré Eux)

### Primary Target Segments
- **Young professionals**: Students, automation specialists wanting to expand
- **Data professionals**: Data scientists, data analysts
- **Design professionals**: Web designers, frontend developers
- **Business students**: Commerce/business school graduates
- **Freelancers**: Web, automation specialists
- **Coding knowledge holders**: People who can code but never complete full projects

### Pain Points by Customer Segment

#### Tech Students (TI, Dev, Tech Programs)
- **Market saturation**: Oversaturated junior developer market
- **Delivery gap**: Can't deliver complete A-Z projects with current tools
- **Portfolio weakness**: Lack quick side projects for professional portfolio

#### Business School Students
- **Technical barrier**: Can't launch software without coding skills
- **Dependency issue**: Need developers to start businesses
- **Time to market**: Takes years to test business ideas

#### Automation Specialists
- **Scope limitation**: Limited to backend work only
- **Service restriction**: Restricted in service offerings
- **Sales challenges**: Struggle with selling expanded capabilities

#### Data Scientists/Data Analysts
- **Production limitations**: Limited in model production and interface creation
- **Developer dependency**: Frustrated depending on developers for complete projects
- **POC trap**: Stuck in proof-of-concept phase, can't reach production
- **Documentation challenges**: Struggle with experimentation tracking, comparison, benchmarking, modeling

#### Web Designers/Frontend Developers
- **Market pressure**: Declining demand, need to expand service offerings
- **AI competition**: AI is more creative, competent, and faster
- **Scope limitation**: Can't build complete applications, stuck at showcase/vitrine level

#### Freelancers (Web, Automation)
- **Delivery pressure**: Need faster delivery to maintain hourly rates
- **Tool limitations**: Limited by current no-code/vibe-code tools
- **Project scope**: Can't handle all types of development projects
- **Profitability issues**: Time spent on certain projects hurts profitability
- **Differentiation challenges**: Difficulty standing out in the market

#### General Coding Knowledge Holders
- **Completion barrier**: Never finish complete projects
- **Learning stagnation**: Feel stuck in learning loop, can't progress
- **Training gap**: No professional training available on complete project delivery
- **Obsolescence fear**: Fear of becoming obsolete with AI/Agents/AGI rise
- **Information overload**: YouTube too complex to navigate for professional, complete content

### Solution Framework: Progressive Learning Path

#### Product Offering Structure
1. **Newcode Document** (Core methodology + checklist, up-to-date tools as upsell)
2. **Formation Débutant**: "Développez n'importe quel site en quelques heures" 
   - Duration: 6 hours
   - Tools: Bolt/Lovable focus
   - Upsell: Business launch methodology
3. **Formation Intermédiaire**: Advanced techniques and workflows (6 hours)
4. **Formation Code Expert**: Complex application development (6 hours)

#### Learning Progression Philosophy
**Sequential capability building**: Non-developers can start with level 1 and progress to coding very complex applications through structured, progressive training modules.

**Key differentiator**: Unlike scattered YouTube content or trial-and-error approaches, provides complete professional methodology for full project lifecycle delivery.
