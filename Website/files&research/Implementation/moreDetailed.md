🚀 Revised Positioning — "AI Development Accelerator" 
You're acting as a senior conversion strategist and technical copywriter for a specialized consulting firm that transforms development teams into AI-powered delivery machines.

🎯 Goal:
Create a homepage that immediately communicates our unique value: We don't just add AI tools to your workflow — we rebuild your entire development pipeline to deliver 3x faster with zero quality compromise.

🧠 Who We Are:
We're the team that turns development bottlenecks into AI-powered highways. We specialize in installing complete AI development ecosystems using Claude-code, CrewAI, MCP integrations, and custom agent orchestration.

Our systems handle: code review, documentation, testing, onboarding, project management integration, and deployment — all automatically, all production-ready.

🧰 What We Deliver:
We build AI systems that eliminate your biggest development pain points:

✅ New developers productive in 2 days (not 2 weeks)
✅ Automatic PR reviews with 90%+ accuracy
✅ Documentation that writes itself
✅ Zero-config CI/CD with intelligent testing
