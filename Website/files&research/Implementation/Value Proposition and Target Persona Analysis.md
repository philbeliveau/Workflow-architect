# Value Proposition and Target Persona Analysis

## Mission Statement
"We transform small development teams into AI-powered productivity machines through done-with-you consulting that delivers measurable workflow acceleration in weeks, not months."

## Core Value Proposition
**For small dev teams drowning in complexity:** We bridge the gap between AI tool potential (30%+ efficiency gains) and reality (10-15% average gains) through hands-on implementation of agentic development workflows that deliver 3x faster delivery with half the burnout.
