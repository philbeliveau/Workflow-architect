🎯 Brand Personality to Reflect
High-tech credibility (you’re not fluff, you’re deep tech)

Velocity and precision (fast iteration, structured orchestration)

Approachability for SMEs (not intimidating like a big 5 consulting firm)

Dark mode native (you already prefer dark backgrounds)

🔍 Brand Feel
Think Nexus meets Cursor, with a slight touch of Replit’s playfulness, but less neon, more calm control.

You are not trying to look like a sci-fi startup, but rather like a black-belt productivity dojo: focused, elite, structured.

Headings: Inter or Satoshi — modern sans-serif with clarity

Body: Space Grotesk, General Sans, or even IBM Plex Sans — professional yet warm
