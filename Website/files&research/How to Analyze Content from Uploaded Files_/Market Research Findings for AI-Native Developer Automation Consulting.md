### Key Bain Research Findings:
- **10-15% average efficiency gains**: Engineering organizations using generative AI tools see efficiency improvements of 10-15% on average
- **30%+ possible with comprehensive approach**: Organizations taking a comprehensive approach can see efficiency gains of 30% or more
- **30% improvement on coding tasks**: Developers report 30% improvement from generative AI on writing and testing code specifically
- **15% net efficiency**: Since developers spend about half their time writing and testing code, this represents 15% net efficiency improvement across total time

### Intuit Case Study - Real-World Implementation:
- **10-15% initial improvement**: Initial generative AI code-generation tool sped up process by 10-15%
- **2-3x faster integration**: By leveraging AI with company-specific code context, reduced integration task completion times by 2-3 times
- **30+ use cases tested**: Moved from "scrappy testing" to scale development with over 30 different use cases

### Key Challenges for Small Teams:
- **Many companies fail to monetize gains**: Unable to reposition saved time and resources to productive uses
- **Need comprehensive approach**: Beyond just code generation - requires full workflow optimization
- **Measurement difficulties**: About two-thirds of leaders aren't satisfied with insights they're getting
- **Black box problem**: Senior executives see software engineering as a black box - don't know where money's going

### Target Market Validation:
